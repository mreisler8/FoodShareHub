Reporting Requirements

For each TC- entry, fill out:

Status: Pass / Fail / Blocked

Actual Result: Describe what happened vs. expected.

Screenshots: Attach or link if UI issues occur.

Severity: Low / Medium / High (e.g., typos vs. broken flows).

Notes & Recommendations: Any UX copy tweaks, missing buttons, styling glitches, error messages, or suggestions for improvement.

Additional Exploratory Checks

Verify mobile-responsive behavior at common breakpoints (e.g., 375×667 px).

Confirm button states (hover, disabled).

Check loading states or error handling (e.g., simulate search API failure).

Deliverable: A structured QA report (spreadsheet or ticket list) with each test case’s results, severity, and recommended actions.
