Context: You're working on "Circles" - a food-focused social recommendation app. Multiple critical issues are preventing core user flows from working properly. The audit shows authentication errors (401), missing navigation paths, and broken button/data flows.

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX IMMEDIATELY:

1. Authentication Flow Breakdown (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

API requests are returning 401 errors, indicating authentication middleware issues
Fix authentication token handling in all API requests
Ensure proper session management and token refresh
Verify authentication middleware is properly applied to protected routes
2. Missing Settings Navigation (CRITICAL)

Settings page exists but isn't accessible from main navigation
Add Settings link to MobileNavigation component (mobile users can't access settings)
Add Settings gear icon to Profile page header for easy access
Ensure DesktopSidebar includes Settings navigation
3. Profile Page Navigation Issues

Profile is only accessible when authenticated but needs better discovery
Fix Profile link visibility and accessibility
Ensure Profile → Settings navigation flow works seamlessly
Add user avatar click navigation to Profile page
4. Search Functionality Problems

Unified search modal may have data flow issues
Verify search API endpoints are properly mounted and responding
Fix any broken search → restaurant detail navigation
Ensure search suggestions and results work end-to-end
5. Component Compilation Errors

Fix ProfileStats component duplicate function declaration error (line 116)
Resolve any TypeScript compilation errors preventing app from running
Ensure all imports and exports are correctly configured
IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

Navigation Fixes:

// Add to MobileNavigation.tsx - Settings should be accessible
// Add to Profile page header - Settings gear icon
// Ensure Router.tsx handles /settings route properly
// Add breadcrumb navigation: Profile ← → Settings
Authentication Fixes:

Verify /api/me endpoint works without 401 errors
Fix authentication token persistence and validation
Ensure all protected routes have proper auth middleware
Fix session handling for persistent login
Button & Data Flow Validation:

Test all navigation buttons lead to correct pages
Verify all form submissions work and persist data
Ensure search functionality works end-to-end
Test Profile → Settings → Profile navigation flow
UX Priorities:

Mobile-first navigation accessibility
Clear visual feedback for all user actions
Proper error handling and user-friendly messages
Consistent navigation patterns across desktop and mobile
Loading states for all async operations
Success Criteria:

Users can access Settings from home screen via Profile → Settings
All API endpoints return proper responses (no 401 errors)
Search functionality works from input to restaurant detail
Profile page loads without compilation errors
All navigation buttons lead to intended destinations
Mobile navigation includes all essential links
Authentication persists across sessions
Form submissions work and provide feedback
Testing Requirements:

Verify each navigation path manually
Test authentication flow completely
Ensure all buttons have working click handlers
Validate mobile responsive behavior
Test error states and recovery flows
Priority Order:

Fix authentication 401 errors immediately
Add missing Settings navigation paths
Resolve ProfileStats compilation error
Verify search end-to-end functionality
Test all navigation flows work correctly
Polish mobile responsiveness and UX
Focus on creating discoverable, intuitive navigation paths that make Settings and Profile easily accessible from anywhere in the app, while ensuring all core functionality works reliably with proper error handling and user feedback.
