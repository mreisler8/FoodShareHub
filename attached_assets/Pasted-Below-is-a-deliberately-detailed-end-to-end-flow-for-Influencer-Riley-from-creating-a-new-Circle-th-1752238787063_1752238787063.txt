Below is a deliberately detailed end-to-end flow for Influencer Riley, from creating a new Circle through sharing her first curated list, with notes on where the UI should “do the heavy lifting” (search, suggestions, templates) versus where Riley customizes.

Riley’s Full Circle Flow
1. Entry Point & Discovery
Landing CTA

On Riley’s dashboard she sees a prominent “Create Circle” card in the Quick Actions area (with a plus-icon and “Circle” label).

Microcopy

Below the button: “Build your trusted foodie community in seconds.”

2. Step 1 → Define Your Circle
Modal / Wizard Stepper

Modal pops up with a 3-step header: Name → Invite → Share.

Name & Theme

Input: Circle Name (placeholder “e.g. Pizza Pals,” “Date-Night Crew”).

Smart Templates: below the field show 3 tappable chips: “Pizza Pals,” “Sushi Squad,” “Weekend Brunchers.”

Tags: free-text tag entry with auto-suggest (“pizza,” “sushi,” “romantic”).

Privacy Toggle

Public / Circle-only radio. Default = Circle-only.

Next Button: disabled until name ≧ 3 chars.

3. Step 2 → Invite Your Members
Search-as-you-type

Single search box: “Find friends by name or email…”

Auto-suggest dropdown shows (“Mia Chen (you follow)”, “Ethan Li”, “+ Invite new email”).

Chips UI

Each selected invitee becomes a removable chip.

Bulk Paste

Secondary link: “Paste emails separated by commas” → expands textarea.

Send Invites

“Send & Finish” button once ≥ 1 chip present.

On click → show toast “2 invites sent!” and advance to Step 3.

4. Step 3 → Share Your First List
Inline Prompt

“Add your favorite pizza spots to get the party started.”

Auto-populated Suggestions

Show trending lists in Riley’s network: e.g. “Top 5 Toronto Pizzas” card with “Add to Circle” button.

Or Create New List

Button: “+ Create Custom List”

List Modal: Name (e.g. “Riley’s Pizza Hits”), Description, Visibility (Circle-only).

Search & Add: type “pizza” → search dropdown from Google Places + internal DB.

Add to List: choose up to 10 restaurants; each becomes a list item with thumbnail.

Reorder via drag-and-drop.

Save & Share → POST → redirect to Circle feed.

5. Circle Home & Feed
Welcome Banner

“Pizza Pals” header with circle avatar (auto-generated from first two initials) and member count.

Tabs:

Feed (default), Members, Lists.

Feed

Shows Riley’s newly shared list card at the top, labeled “Shared by you.”

Others’ posts/lists appear below, sorted by recency or “hot”.

Members

Grid of member avatars + roles (owner/admin/member) with “Remove” only if you’re owner.

Lists

Grid of all lists shared in this circle, with ratings and count badges.

6. Continuous Engagement
Notifications

Riley immediately sees “Bob accepted your invite!” in the top-nav bell.

Next-Best Actions

Under the feed: “Your Circle has no reviews yet. Invite more friends or add a review.”

Micro-Interactions

Hover on list cards reveals “Edit” and “Add item” icons.

Clicking “Add item” opens inline search + add UI buried under that card.

Customization vs. Assumed/Search Automation
You Customize	UI Should Automate/Recommend
• Your Circle Name, Description & Tags	• Name Templates (common themes) as one-click chips
• Invitee selection (which friends/emails exactly)	• Auto-suggest friends based on past interactions/follow
• Building a brand-new list (name + description)	• Trending/Popular lists for quick “Add to Circle” cards
• Curating specific restaurants in a custom list	• Google Places autocomplete + internal DB cross-ref
• Final privacy settings	• Sensible default toggles (Circle-only)

Best-in-Class UX Notes
Progressive Disclosure

Only ask for details you can’t infer. Name+tags → Invite → Content.

Templates & Defaults

Keep Riley moving quickly with pre-filled options (templates, default privacy).

Inline Feedback

Disable “Next” until valid; show real-time validation/errors.

Toasts and inline toasts on invite send and list share.

Search-First

Wherever Riley types, show instant suggestions (friends, restaurants, lists).

Ownership Signals

Clear “Shared by you” badge and role labels so Riley knows her power.

Mobile/Responsive

Step wizard becomes full-screen slide cards on mobile, with a sticky bottom CTA.

By blending Riley’s desire for full control (naming, curating) with smart defaults and search-driven suggestions, you’ll empower your influencer persona to build vibrant, trusted circles in under 60 seconds—and keep them coming back for more.
