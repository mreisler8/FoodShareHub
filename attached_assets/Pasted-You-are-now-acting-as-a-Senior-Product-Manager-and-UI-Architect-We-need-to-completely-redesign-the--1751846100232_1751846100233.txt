You are now acting as a Senior Product Manager and UI Architect.
We need to completely redesign the Home/Landing page in our React app to deliver a clean, modern, persona-driven experience for Tracker Taylor (our power-user) while still serving Explorer Alex, Seeker Sam, and Influencer Riley.

Your mission:

Build a new HeroSection with a single “New Post” CTA.

Create a Card component for all previews.

Build a QuickAddPanel for inline posting.

Reorder and restyle the four main sections (Hero → My Lists → Top Picks → Feed).

Ensure consistent spacing, typography, and responsive behavior.

Use the file paths and code snippets below. After implementation, run a quick QA against Tracker Taylor’s flows (create list, add restaurant, share list).

User Stories & Implementation Details

Hero Section

Story: As a user, I want a focused hero at the top with my name and one “New Post” button so I immediately know my primary action.

Files: src/components/HeroSection.tsx + HeroSection.css

Snippet: (See code below)

Card Component

Story: As a user, I want all preview items (lists, picks, feed cards) to share the same styling so the UI feels cohesive.

Files: src/components/Card.tsx + Card.css

Snippet: (See code below)

Quick-Add Panel

Story: As a user, I want to instantly search and start a post inline, so I can share on the fly without opening a modal.

Files: src/components/QuickAddPanel.tsx + QuickAddPanel.css

Snippet: (See code below)

Page Layout

Story: As a returning user, I want My Lists first, then Top Picks, then my Feed, so I can resume my highest-priority work.

Files: src/pages/HomePage.tsx + HomePage.css

Snippet: (See code below)

Responsive & Theming

Ensure a two-column layout on desktop and stacked single column on mobile (≤375px).

Use the unified <Button> component for all CTAs.
