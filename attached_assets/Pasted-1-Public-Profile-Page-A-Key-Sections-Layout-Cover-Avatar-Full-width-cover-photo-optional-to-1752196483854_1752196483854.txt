1. Public Profile Page
A. Key Sections & Layout
Cover & Avatar

Full-width cover photo (optional) to let people personalize their space.

Circular avatar overlapping the cover.

Avatar click opens a simple crop-and-upload modal.

Name & Handle

Prominent display name + @handle on one line.

Sub-text for location or title (e.g. “Toronto Food Explorer”).

Bio & Links

A short bio (100–150 chars max) with inline links (restaurants, circles, personal site).

Option to pin up to 3 “pinned lists” or highlights below the bio.

Stats Bar

Clickable counters: Reviews, Lists, Circles, Followers, Following.

Hover or tap shows a mini-tooltip with contextual info (“You follow 12/45 of their circles”).

Primary Actions

For your own profile: Edit Profile (solid primary), Settings (icon).

For others: Follow/Unfollow, Message, Invite to Circle (dropdown with circles).

Content Tabs

“Reviews”, “Lists”, “Circles”, “Saved” tabs.

Each tab loads via client-side routing for instant transitions.

A secondary filter bar inside each tab (e.g. sort by date, rating, popularity).

Feed & Highlights

In “Reviews,” infinite scroll of that user’s posts.

In “Lists,” a masonry/grid of list cards with cover images.

In “Circles,” show circles they’ve created or joined (small avatars of members).

Responsive & Accessible

On mobile, collapse stats into a horizontal swipeable strip.

All images lazy-loaded; buttons sized for thumb taps.

Ensure proper focus outlines, aria-labels, and color contrast.
