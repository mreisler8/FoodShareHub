# ROLE & MISSION  
You are our Senior Product Manager & World-Class Replit Coder. Phase 1 is all about **trusted, collaborative lists**‚Äîmaking them rich, interactive, and crystal-clear in terms of privacy.

# PERSONA ALIGNMENT  
- **Tracker Taylor** must be able to discuss each restaurant entry with friends, record ratings/notes, and filter/sort their collaborative lists.  
- **Explorer Alex**, **Seeker Sam**, and **Influencer Riley** benefit downstream once the core collaboration UX is rock-solid.

## FEATURE 1: Item-Level Comments  
**User Story**  
> As a user  
> I want to comment on each restaurant in a list  
> So that my trusted circle can share their opinions directly on that item  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. Under each list‚Äêitem row on `ListDetailPage`, show a ‚Äúüí¨ Comments (N)‚Äù toggle.  
2. Clicking it expands an inline `ItemComments` component that:  
   - **GET**s `/api/list-items/:itemId/comments` and renders each comment (author + timestamp + content).  
   - Provides a textarea + ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button to **POST** `{ itemId, content }` to `/api/list-items/:itemId/comments`.  
3. Only circle members (or public viewers if list is public) can view/post comments.

## FEATURE 2: Rich List-Item Metadata  
**User Story**  
> As a list creator  
> I want to record a rating, price assessment, and personal notes per item  
> So that we can compare and filter entries later  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. Extend **AddListItemModal** to include:  
   - **Rating** (‚òÖ 1‚Äì5)  
   - **Price Assessment** dropdown (`Great value` / `Fair` / `Overpriced`)  
   - **Notes** (free-text)  
2. Persist these fields in the `restaurant_list_items` table.  
3. Display the rating (‚òÖ X), price text, and notes under each item in `ListDetailPage`.

## FEATURE 3: Aggregation & Sorting/Filtering  
**User Story**  
> As a circle member  
> I want to see ‚ÄúAvg Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4.2)‚Äù and filter by cuisine or location  
> So that I can quickly find the best recommendations in that list  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. **ListDetailPage** header shows aggregated stats:  
   - **Avg Rating**, **Count**, **Filter dropdowns** for ‚ÄúCuisine‚Äù and ‚ÄúCity‚Äù.  
2. **Filter & Sort Controls** above the item list:  
   - `Sort by: [Rating ‚Üì|‚Üë]`, `Filter: [Cuisine ‚ñæ]`, `Filter: [City ‚ñæ]`.  
3. Requests to **GET** `/api/lists/:id/items?sort=rating&filter[cuisine]=italian&filter[city]=Toronto` return the correctly ordered/filtered array.

## FEATURE 4: Clarify Private vs. Public Toggles  
**User Story**  
> As a list creator  
> I want the share controls labeled clearly ‚ÄúPrivate: share with circles‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúPublic: anyone can see‚Äù  
> So that there‚Äôs no confusion about who will view or edit the list  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. In **CreateListModal** and **ListSettings**, replace generic ‚ÄúShare to Circle(s)‚Äù label with:  
   - **Private:** Share only with‚Ä¶ (multi-select circles)  
2. Beneath it, a collapsed **More options** section containing:  
   - **Public:** Anyone can view this list (toggle, off by default)  
3. Ensure defaults are **private** and **Public** toggle is tucked away.

# IMPLEMENTATION TASKS & FILES

### 1. Schema Updates  
- **File**: `shared/schema.ts`  
  ```diff
  export const restaurantListItems = pgTable("restaurant_list_items", {
    // existing‚Ä¶
  +  rating: integer("rating"),
  +  priceAssessment: text("price_assessment"),
  +  notes: text("notes"),
  });
Migration: run Drizzle migration to alter table.

2. API Routes
Item Comments:

server/routes/list-item-comments.ts

ts
Copy
Edit
router.get("/:itemId/comments", authenticate, listComments);
router.post("/:itemId/comments", authenticate, addComment);
List Items:

Extend server/routes/list-items.ts for POST to accept rating, priceAssessment, notes.

Aggregates & Filters:

Update GET /api/lists/:id/items in server/routes/lists.ts to accept sort & filter query params and include AVG(rating) in response.

3. Frontend Components
AddListItemModal:

client/src/components/AddListItemModal.tsx ‚Üí add inputs for rating, price, notes.

ListDetailPage:

client/src/pages/ListDetailPage.tsx ‚Üí
